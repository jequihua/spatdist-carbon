Spatial Distribution of Carbon Stocks along Protected and non-Protected Coastal Wetland Ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico. 

Highlights
*Carbon stocks vary across intra-coastal wetland ecosystems 
*Both herbaceous and arboreal species in coastal wetland ecosystems have the potential to store large carbon stocks. 
*Canopy height, short-wave infra-red optical band as synthetic images from radar technology are good predictors of useful to predict aboveground carbon stocks.  
*Hydrological predictors were the best predictors? of have great influence on the distribution of  belowground carbon spatial distribution model.    
*Understanding the distribution of carbon stocks can inform decision-making processes for effective conservation and sustainable management practices.
